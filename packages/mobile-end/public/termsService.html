    us to use the Services unless you want to pay the Admission Fee for permission to play the premium game resource,
    where you will be given access to game points and/or game currency and/or game items etc. (“Premium Game Resource”).
    The Admission Fee that is paid by you for permission to play the premium game resource shall expire after one (1)
    month from the date of purchase.</p>
  <p>You agree not to pay the Admission Fee by exploiting the bugs in the Services,
    on the Web Site, and/or within our Services and system which may cause unfair transaction between you and MOREFUN or
    gain unfair advantage in the Services, or through informal channels which are not provided directly by MOREFUN, or
    any
    other channels unauthorized by MOREFUN (the Informal Channels). You undertake any loss due to paying the Admission
    Fee
    through Informal Channels. For any Account found to pay through the Informal Channels, we reserve the right to
    reduce,
    suspend, alter, delete or terminate the Account, or its data; we also have the right to identify it as a fraud, in
    our
    sole discretion.</p>
  <p>(a) Promotion Program</p>
  <p>We may as a gesture of goodwill and in our sole discretion, in the
    light of our budgeted operation costs, allow you to use the Services with only the free game resource which shall
    refer to the basic game items and other items as we may decide from time to time in our sole discretion (“Free Game
    Resource”). This promotion program is conducted by us at no charge and you agree and acknowledge that we are under
    no
    obligation to allow you access to the Free Game Resource and we may terminate this promotion program and/or any and
    all Services or your access thereto (subject to Clause 5(c)(ii)) at any time in our sole discretion, without any
    liability to you whatsoever.</p>
  <p>(b) Pay the Admission Fee for permission to play the Premium Game Resource</p>
  <p>
    The payment of the Admission Fee shall be on the terms as set out in this Agreement, in particular, Clause 5(c)(i)
    and
    Clause 5(d) and not on a pre-paid advance basis. In consideration of your payment of the Admission Fee, we shall
    offer
    to you a limited license to access to such Premium Game Resource as we may stipulate on the Web Site, from time to
    time. You may first be given a MOREFUN Points Card (the “Points Card”) that represents a certain amount of MOREFUN
    Points which can be exchanged to other Premium Game Resource, such as MOREFUN Game points, MOREFUN Game currency, or
    MOREFUN Game Items for the Services. If you choose to pay by using Credit Cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Play, and
    such other payment instruments and channels (such as through Facebook Credits) as we may permit from time to time,
    your payment will be processed by the relevant merchant service provider and/or other relevant third party. All
    parents and legal guardians are liable for any use of their credit cards and other payment instruments and channels
    by
    their child/ward. You agree to the terms of service and privacy policy of any third party that provide such payment
    channels or instruments that you choose to use.</p>
  <p>If you select to play a Free Game Resource or Premium Game
    Resource (collectively, the “Game Resource”), you agree that you have understood how the Game Resource is used in
    the
    Services and are fully responsible for all the consequences related to the use or transfer of such Game
    Resource.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the terminology that you “buy” or “earn” or “win” or “take possession of” any Game Resource or that
    we have “delivered” to you any Game Resource including without limitation any virtual game currency or other similar
    terminology, you acknowledge that you do not actually own the virtual game items or any credit balance in real
    currency or its equivalent and are not entitled to reimbursement of or exchange for any “real-world” monies or
    monetary value. You agree that the Game Resource you access (and all underlying intellectual property) are
    properties
    of ours and what you obtain is merely a limited license to access such Game Resource in the Services in accordance
    with this Agreement. We also reserve the right to not grant access of the Game Resource to certain Users.</p>
  <p>(c)
    Payment Term</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(i) Cash on Delivery</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Upon receiving your payment of the Admission Fee, we are obliged to display Services in accordance with Clause
    5(c)(ii), and make delivery of the Premium Game Resource on a “Cash-On-Delivery” basis, and not on
    when-and-if-available basis (without prejudice to Clauses 11, 12, 13 and 16). In this regard, the delivery of the
    Premium Game Resource has occurred when you first have taken possession of the MOREFUN Points Cards or any other
    Premium Game Resource (i.e. when this is first delivered to your Account) upon your payment of the Admission Fee, as
    we would grant you permission to play such Premium Game Resource from, and accordingly the Restricted Game Life (as
    defined below) commences from, your payment of the Admission Fee (subject to processing time). You are encouraged to
    play the Premium Game Resource promptly and we shall not be liable to you in any manner (whether for the refund of
    the
    Admission Fee or otherwise) if you do not play the Premium Game Resource by the expiry of the Restricted Game Life
    (unless, and to such extent that, such failure to use is due to a breach by us of this Agreement).</p>
  <p>Restricted
    Game Life” refers to the validity period of the Premium Game Resource pursuant to your payment of the Admission Fee,
    i.e. the period during which we have any obligations to you in relation to the Premium Game Resource and during
    which
    you are permitted to play the Premium Game Resource. The Restricted Game Life is a period of one (1) month
    commencing
    from the date of your payment of the Admission Fee. Upon the expiry of the Restricted Game Life, we no longer have
    any
    obligation to you and you shall have no rights to access the Premium Game Resource. Please also see the
    concessionary
    period for Services as stated in Clause 5(c)(ii) below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(ii) One (1) month Concessionary period to continue displaying game</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this regard, you agree that we are only obliged to continue displaying Services for one (1) month from the
    date of your payment of the Admission Fee, which you agree is a reasonable validity period. Thereafter, you agree
    and
    acknowledge that we may terminate any and all Services or your access thereto at any time in our sole discretion,
    without any liability to you whatsoever.</p>
  <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing is without prejudice to
    Clauses 11, 12, 13 and 16.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(iii) Discharge of obligation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You understand and agree that the performance by us of the various stages of the transactions as contemplated in
    this Agreement are completed and executed and all our obligations are discharged and extinguished upon the
    expiration
    of the one (1) month concessionary period.</p>
  <p>Thus, in substance, economic reality, and substantive law, you have
    no further rights to demand to play and we have no further obligation to display any Services for using, upon the
    expiration of the one (1) month concessionary period.</p>
  <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing is without
    prejudice to Clauses 11, 12, 13 and 16.</p>
  <p>(d) Return Policy. The payment of the Admission fee for permission to
    access the Premium Game Resource (including MOREFUN Points Card), its related sub-domains, any merchant service
    provider and/or other third party platforms requires acceptance of the terms of service and privacy policy of such
    merchant service provider and/or third party platform prior to the use of such merchant service provider and/or
    third
    party platform (as the case may be). The act of downloading, viewing, or using such payment channels and instruments
    constitutes acceptance of their terms of service and privacy policy.</p>
  <p>You agree and consent that due to the
    special nature of online game services, there is no physical goods transaction, and your purchasing experience comes
    from online game services provided by the game manufacturer. Therefore, refund is not applicable unless the game
    operation is terminated.</p>
  <p>You shall not be entitled to any concession in respect of this payment term. If any
    payment is disputed or charged back, the associated Account(s) or access through the associated Account(s) may be
    suspended, terminated, or other actions in our sole discretion, if any fraudulent activity is detected.</p>
  <p>(e)
    Security and Anti-Fraud. For security and anti-fraud purpose, we may require any User, whether prior to or after
    payment of the Admission Fee, to provide personal information such as name, address, phone number, social security
    number, and copy of picture ID. Users may also be required to write and sign a statement certifying that their
    purchases are authorized and legitimate. Failure to do so may result in suspension of the associated Account or of
    access through the associated Account.</p>
  <p><h3>6. TRADING AMONG USERS</h3></p>
  <p>All trading, sublicensing,
    renting, leasing, loaning, selling or transfers of Accounts, characters or Game Resource, including without
    limitation, trading of Account ID, Account Names, and all out-of-game transfers, are strictly prohibited. Further,
